Neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and anxiety disorders are characterized by a complex range of symptoms, including social behaviour and cognitive deficits, depression and repetitive behaviours. Although the mechanisms driving pathophysiology are complex and remain largely unknown, advances in the understanding of gene association and gene networks are providing significant clues to their aetiology. In recent years, small noncoding RNA molecules known as microRNA (miRNA) have emerged as a new gene regulatory layer in the pathophysiology of mental illness. These small RNAs can bind to the 3'-UTR of mRNA thereby negatively regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Their ability to regulate hundreds of target mRNAs simultaneously predestines them to control the activity of entire cellular pathways, with obvious implications for the regulation of complex processes such as animal behaviour. There is growing evidence to suggest that numerous miRNAs are dysregulated in pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, and there is strong genetic support for the association of miRNA genes and their targets with several of these conditions. This review attempts to cover the most relevant microRNAs for which an important contribution to the control of social and anxiety-related behaviour has been demonstrated by functional studies in animal models. In addition, it provides an overview of recent expression profiling and genetic association studies in human patient-derived samples in an attempt to highlight the most promising candidates for biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention.
