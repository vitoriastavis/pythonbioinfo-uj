## Exercises for the course 'Python Programming for Bioinformatics' from the Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology at Jagiellonian University 

The course covered:

Applications of bioinformatic services and biological databases (NCBI Entrez, RCSB, PDB, Uniprot, Expasy, PROSITE and PRINTS, Gene Ontology). Techniques for quantitative comparison of amino acid and nucleotide sequences:
dynamic programming and heuristic algorithms (BLAST, FASTA, Clustal), substitution scoring matrices (PAM, BLOSUM).

The final project investigated antimicrobial resistance determinants in _S. aureus_ from translated ORFs using BLAST.
